üöÄ **RAGIC has been accepted by IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering (TKDE) 2025!** üéâ  

## üîπ Overview  

RAGIC (**R**isk-**A**ware **G**enerative model for **I**nterval **C**onstruction) is a novel deep learning framework designed for **stock market interval prediction**, addressing the **stochastic nature of financial markets**. Unlike traditional point prediction, RAGIC forecasts a **price range** (lower and upper bounds), providing **uncertainty-aware and risk-sensitive predictions**.  

### üåü **Key Features**  
- **Risk-Aware Forecasting**: Integrates the **volatility index** to **dynamically adjust interval width** based on market risk.  
- **Generative Model for Market Scenarios**: Uses **GANs** to simulate **diverse market conditions**, including extreme events.  
- **Two-Phase Framework**:  
  1. **Sequence Generation**: GAN-based model learns historical stock patterns and simulates future price sequences.  
  2. **Interval Construction**: A **horizon-wise strategy** gathers predictions across different time horizons, adjusting **risk-sensitive intervals** adaptively.  
- **Lightweight & Scalable**: Trained **once**, reusable for multiple sequence generations, relying on **public data only**.  
- **State-of-the-Art Performance**: Achieves **95%+ coverage** with **narrow, informative intervals**, outperforming baselines on global stock indices.

## üìñ **Methodology**  

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Sequence Generation (GAN-based Forecasting)**  
RAGIC employs a **GAN model** to generate diverse **future price sequences** by learning historical market features. The **generator** consists of:  
- **Risk Module**: Captures market risk via a **risk attention score** derived from the **volatility index** (e.g., VIX for SPX, VXD for DOW).  
- **Temporal Module**: Extracts **multi-scale trends** from historical prices, capturing both **local** and **global** patterns.  
- **Latent Space Randomness**: Introduces stochasticity throughout the model layers, ensuring realistic financial variability.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Interval Construction (Risk-Sensitive Prediction Intervals)**  
- Implements a **horizon-wise strategy** to aggregate multiple simulated sequences.  
- Uses **statistical inference** to construct **adaptive intervals** with width based on market risk.  
- A **wider interval** signals higher market volatility, aiding in **risk assessment and hedging strategies**.
